Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is procedural or systematic approach of delivering an effective software product through design, development, testing, deployment and maintenace.
Software engineering has solved quite a number of challenges and as well made life easier and more related than it was by For example; use of software applications to simplify the day to day life activities of mankind all round.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The 3 mile stones are leasted below
1. Development of prgramming language in 1960s
2. Establishment of software programming as a disclipline as the advent of strutured programming language in 1970s
3. The rise of agile methodologies in 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Software requirement - Gathering documentation on user needs and specifications of the software
2. Software Design - Create high level and detailed, as well as user friendly designs based on software requirements
3. Software Implementation - Writing code according to the design specifications
4. Software testing - Testing the software if it meets functional requirements and quality standard
5. Software Deployment - Deploy or release to user for usage, users can download from their respective stores
6. Software Maintenance - This requires software updates and provide realtime support on the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Water fall is distinct like one way while Agile is not
Water fall follows a linear procedure without change while agile is iterational; changes can occur during development stage or after.
Example: Building an iphone hardware is a water model while building the applications can be agile

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
**Software developer:** He is responsible for writing code according to the designs created by the UI/UX designer to activate the usefulness of the software
**Quality Assurance:** He is responsible for designing and executing test plans for the software
**Project Manager:** He handles software management from the development stage to production/delivery stage  

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
**IDEs:** This is industrous application that enables developers to write, debugging and testing codes. Eg Visual studio code, Visual basic, IntelliJ IDEA
**VCs:** Software tools that helps in tracking changes in source codes and version control. Eg Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Change in Requirements can cause delays in projects
2. Tight deadline can lead to rush which can cause defects in the quality of the software projects
3. Technical debts rises in future increments in technical software maintenance costs

   Challenges can be overcomed when the requirements and goals are reassessed from time to time, tasks are priotized with consistency to meet up on or before deadlines and effective communication goes a long way fixing up issues


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing requires testing for an individual components or modules of software
integration testing requires testing for components and subcomponents interaction
system testing requires an overall testing of the software system
acceptance testing requires testing the software if it meets up with user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is a technique in which a prompt is made clear, specific and concised for AI models to interact with effectively

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example is "What is AI?" This is a vague prompt.
"What is AI?" Explain What AI is a beginner of no experience who just start learning what AI is. This is an improved prompt
