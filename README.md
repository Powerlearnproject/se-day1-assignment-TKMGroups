# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is procedural or systematic approach of delivering an effective software product through design, development, testing, deployment and maintenace.
Software engineering has solved quite a number of challenges and as well made life easier and more related than it was by For example; use of software applications to simplify the day to day life activities of mankind all round.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The 3 mile stones are leasted below
1. Development of prgramming language in 1960s
2. Establishment of software programming as a disclipline as the advent of strutured programming language in 1970s
3. The rise of agile methodologies in 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
